# Stream-Live-data-using-ThingsBoard-
● This project aims to simulate streaming live sensor data from IoT devices. The MQTT protocol is first used to produce sensor data. Then, data is published to a broker environment for tracking and analysis using a real-time widget and alarm notifications. Finally, all published data are sent to a realtime database. ● The project made use of Mosquitto, ThingsBoard, and Firebase environments. Program file is written in python and selected environments are set up via Docker.
